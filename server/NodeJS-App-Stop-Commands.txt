Node.js App Stop Commands - Print Friendly

Problem: "Can't acquire lock for app" error in cPanel Node.js interface

Solution: Use terminal commands to kill Node.js processes

Commands to try in order:

1. Basic kill: pkill -f node

2. Force kill: pkill -9 -f node

3. Target server.js: pkill -f "server.js"

4. Find and kill all: ps aux | grep node | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9

5. Clean lock files: rm -f /tmp/.node-app-lock* ~/.pm2/logs/* ~/.pm2/pids/*

Quick Solution (recommended): pkill -9 -f node && sleep 5 && echo "Node processes killed"

Try starting your app in cPanel again
Note: The lock error should be resolved after running these commands.
